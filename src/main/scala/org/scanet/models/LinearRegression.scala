/** Ordinary least squares Linear Regression.
  *
  * LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients `w = (w1, â€¦, wn)`
  * to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset,
  * and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.
  *
  * Model always has only one output
  *
  * That is equivalent to `layer.Dense(1, Identity)`
